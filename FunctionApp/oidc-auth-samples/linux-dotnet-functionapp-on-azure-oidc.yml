name: Build and deploy .NET project to Azure Function App using OIDC

# CONFIGURATION
#
# This workflow can be used to deploy your .NET project to a function app on any hosting plan, except for Container Apps (which uses functions-container-action).
#
# For an overview of using GitHub workflows with Azure Functions, see https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-github-actions
#
# 1. Configure a federated identity credential to your GitHub branch on an Azure user-assigned managed identity.
#   For instructions, follow the README at https://github.com/Azure/functions-action#use-oidc-recommended
#
# 2. Add the following values from the managed identity to your repo's variables:
#   AZURE_CLIENT_ID
#   AZURE_TENANT_ID
#   AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
#   For instructions on creating repo variables, see https://docs.github.com/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#defining-configuration-variables-for-multiple-workflows
#
# 3. Ensure your workflow is triggered by your desired event. By default, it is triggered when a push is made to main, and it can be manually run.
#   For guidance on event triggers, see https://docs.github.com/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/triggering-a-workflow#using-events-to-trigger-workflows
#
# 4. Change the variables in the `env` section according to your project:
#   For the latest list of supported runtimes, see https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/supported-languages
